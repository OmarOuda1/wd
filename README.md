# wd
This is a rewrite of warp directory because I don't use ohmyzsh.
## The Originals [wd(ohmyzsh)][https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd] [wd(bash)][https://github.com/troyxmccall/wd] 
## Note This script only works in zsh if you want something for bash consider using [wd(bash)][https://github.com/troyxmccall/wd] 
## How to install
To use it you need to add an alias or a function to your zshrc to source the script.
you can store the script any where you just need to source it.
